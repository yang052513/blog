# COMP3522 C++ Practice Midterm

## PART A: Theory

### 1. What is a copy constructor? When is it used? Be specific. Code snippets may be used as an example

A copy constructor is when an object is intilized with another object that passed to. It's used when we want to copy all the members to another object. For example below, we created `hero1` object, and invoke copy constructor for `hero2` object. `hero1` and `hero2` are now all have same `strength` value. However, by invoking default copy constructor, we find that both `hero1` and `hero2` are pointing to same memory address which lead to shallow copy problem.

```c++
class Hero {
private:
    double strength;
public:
    Hero(double strength) {
        this->strength = strength;
    }
    double getStrength() {
        return strength;
    }
}

int main() {
    Hero hero1(87.0);
    Hero hero2 = hero1;
    std::cout << hero1.getStrength() << " " << &hero1 << std::endl;
    std::cout << hero2.getStrength() << " " << &hero2 << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. What is a reference? How is it different from a pointer?

A reference is an alias which can be used to refer an existing object. A pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable. However, unlike pointer we can initialized with `nullptr`, we need to initaized reference before created.

```c++
int main() {
    string food = "Ramen";
    string *food2; // init with null ptr
    food2 = &food; // point to food
    string &food3 = food; // food reference called food3

    food3 = "Burger";
    *food2 = "Chicken";

    cout << food << " " << "Memory address: " << &food << endl;
    cout << *food2 << " " << "Memory address: " << food2 << endl;
    cout << food3 << " " << "Memory address: " << &food3 << endl;
}
```

### 3. In C++, we may pass arguments to functions by value, by pointer, or by reference. What is the difference? Why would we choose one over the other?

- Pass arguments by value will create a copy of the value and pass to the functions, which doesnt impact the original value
- Pass by pointer which will pass the variable that holds the memory address
- Pass by reference will pass the same variable that referred to, which has same memory location

```c++
void swapByValue(int a, int b) {
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}

void swapByPointer(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a; // create variable temp holds a address
    *a = *b;  // swap address
    *b = temp;
}

void swapByReference(int &a, int &b) {
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}


int main() {
    int n1 = 5;
    int n2 = 12;

    swapByValue(n1, n2);
    swapByPointer(&n1, &n2);
    swapByReference(n1, n2);
    return 0;
}

```

### 4. Suppose we have a C++ string called success. What is the difference between `&success` and `success&`? When would we use each of these?

`&success` is the memory address of string success. `success&` is used to pass string `success` as a reference to function

### 5. What is the difference between static allocation and dynamic allocation? You may provide code snippets to help illustratet the difference.
