> So it's almost been 5 months since the quarantine started, and my school closed since then. Some people might compliant about the lock down cause we cant hangout or whatever reasons. I am also kind worried because no gym means no gains, and I cant code with my friends. However, it turns out pretty well, I found out my learning philosophy, and actually, learning or training alone is kind better for me.

In April, I bought some lifting equipments from Rougue. I thought I am well ahead compared to others since one month later everything just out of stock. Well, I did not receive my package for twice. Everytime they lost something and I need to recall Rogue service center. Sucks. Finally, I received everything at the end of the April, and my training starts again.

In May, my frined Wenbo and me finished the [noPandemic](https://github.com/yang052513/no-pandemic) project for COMP2800. It's my first name using react which collaborate in a team. I found out design is way more important than I thought. We made some basic UI design, but during the later stage we got some trouble with mobile version because the layout is kind comoplex. That part waste us a lot of time. Never mind, our project got 1st place with most creative and best teamwork prizes. Good result anyway.

After the project, I soon moved onto my next personal project, `ProjectHub` which is the project I want to do for really long time. The sorting algorithim is hard, but I figured out. The friend system is hard, but we did it. Solving problem is really fun process, and way better compared to the boring textbook exercises.

Then, I found out I need to use some regular expression for my project. OK, let's learn some Regular expression.

Later, I found a animation called Soul Land and just cant stop watching it, so I decide to download all the episodes and watch on my TV. However, there are 108 episodes, and I DONT WANT TO CLICK ONE BY ONE. So turns out we need to learn some python.

Man, python is good.

At first, I was thinking like "what? no need to declare variable type??", or "wtf is def():, why not function??".

However, human is flexible. Python is best.

Later, I just falled in love with crawler. Why? Because it's fun, and it sovled many automated problems for me. I started with `request` library which is all you need for scraping static sites, then I moved to selenium cause some sites use ajax and js to dynamically loading contents, and selenium could act like a human manipulate a browser. I also learned Fiddler which could use for get request from mobile apps.

Back to the training, what surprised me is that I dont need a fancy program and can still make awesome progress. LOL. I cant imagine I used to pay so much money to a coach just for some excel sheet programs. Especially bench, all I am doing is just more volume. Deadlift is even simple, adding reps every week and then re-cycle every month.

It works. Everything will work as long as logic.
